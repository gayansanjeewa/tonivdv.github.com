One of my favorite blogs is that of jQuery 4 Designers and this time he created a cool tutorial on how to create one with jQuery.

It has always been a struggle to create a nice carousel but i think this guy managed to create a real cool one. Also one of the most interesting things about this website is that all the code he writes in jQuery also works after disabling JavaScript. Try it!
