This weekend developers of PHP announced that name spacing will be possible (this is old news) but they will be using the backslash as separator (that’s the fresh news). 

I really think that it’s quite weird to use the backslash instead of :: but they really thought it trough. 

You can take a look at a table of pro’s and con’s they made <a href="http://wiki.php.net/rfc/namespaceseparator" target="_blank">here</a>.

It ‘s cool to read the discussion of these guys <a href="http://wiki.php.net/_media/rfc/php.ns.txt?id=rfc%3Anamespaceseparator&cache=cache" target="_blank">here</a>.
