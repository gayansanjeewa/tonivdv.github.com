I was listening to the radio in my car this morning and overheard an interview with the Flemish godfather of the internet, Mister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" target="_blank">Robert Cailiau</a>.

> In December 1974 he started working at [CERN][1] as a Fellow in the Proton Synchrotron (PS) division, working on the control system of the accelerator. In April 1987 he left the PS division to become group leader of Office Computing Systems in the Data Handling division. In 1989, [Tim Berners-Lee][2] proposed a [hypertext][3] system for access to the many forms of documentation at and related to CERN. Berners-Lee created the system, calling it [World Wide Web][4], between September to December 1990. During this time, Cailliau and he co-authored a proposal for funding for the project. Cailliau later became a key proponent of the project.

I was surprised as I didn&#8217;t know that a Flemish (Belgian) guy was the inventor of the World Wide Web and it took place exactly 20 years ago from today (13/03/1989).  
At the end of the interview they asked him how much money he gained of his invention and his answer was&#8230;. 0 $ as he was working for the university and not for a private instance. The guy has to do it with respect; well he deserves every bit of it.

The founders of the technologies we use today aren&#8217;t that celebrated as they should be, and others, well others are big money earners.
