Writing css code isn&#8217;t that hard, it&#8217;s easy, clean but can be a pain in the ass to keep it readable when you have hundreds or maybe thousands of lines of code.

When sticking to specific rules it can all be made a bit more readable:

  * alphabetize
  * write comment
  * consistency
  * start in the right place
  * Understanding Class and ID
  * Power of li
  * CSS Debugging Tools
