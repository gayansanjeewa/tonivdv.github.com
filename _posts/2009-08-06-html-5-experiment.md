<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-868" title="html5-canvas-particles2" src="http://www.devexp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/html5-canvas-particles2-300x109.png" alt="html5-canvas-particles2" width="300" height="109" />This is super cool!!!!

9Elements created a completely html page containing nothing more then Javascript and some of the tags that are created in the new HTML version.

This is really amazing as it is really the first time that I see a website that does some things I thought could only be done with Flash. I m overwhelmed with it an I suggest you take a look at it!! Be sure to look at it in an advanced browser ( Google Chrome 3.0, Safari 4 or the latest Firefox 3.5 version).
