Well if you work in a big company you probably won’t do the two jobs, but in some cases, or when you work in a small company (ex 1-5 employees) you have to do them both (layout and programming). And for those guys, it isn’t always easy to have inspiration right away, well there is a solution.

Here are a few sites that have a huge portfolio with nice layout sites. You can grab the css in some cases, and that’s the interesting part of it.

Take a look at them.
