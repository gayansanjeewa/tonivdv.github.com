<img class="alignright" title="box 3d" src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:yxRz3ghIwO5xbM:http://www.thedom.fr/share/thumbs/TheDom-3Dbox-Big.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="135" height="67" />Everybody who uses Photoshop knows the advantage of using actions and since a long time I was creating my own actions when for example trying to resize a lot of images at once. An action is nothing more than a series of commands you play back on a file.Â  Off course you only use and create these actions when you really need them but today I discovered that a lot of sites share their actions with the world. They make it possible to create, in one click; a 3dbox, page curls, 3d-collage effect, old preachment view etc.

For an example of this nice work you can visit <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psactions/?alltime=yes&order=9" target="_blank">deviantart</a>, they have a nice collection of actions. (and other Photoshop and Illustrator utilities)

When you&#8217;re not into these actions but interested in Photoshop, believe me, actions are a really cool and timesaving thing. Learn it.
