You can never get enough interviews, at least if they are a bit interestingâ€¦  
This time we got an interview with Mr Jean-Baptiste Jung, a very friendly and ambitious guy with little spare time as he mentioned in his interview.

> My name is Jean-Baptiste Jung (Pronounce: Young) and I&#8217;m a 27 years old blogger, web developer and web designer from the French-speaking part of Belgium.  
> I started blogging in 2006 by writing a blog in French about the Python programming language. I quickly dropped this blog and created a new one, <a href="http://www.Lyxia.org" target="_blank">Lyxia.org</a> to discuss a lot of nice things about the Internet: Web development, Web design, blogging, WordPress and much more. After this successful experience, I decided to create a similar blog, but in English. This is how, in June 2008, I created <a href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/" target="_blank">Cats Who Code</a>.  
> I&#8217;m also an author on several popular blogs as such as <a href="http://wphacks.com/" target="_blank">WpHacks</a>, <a href="http://www.problogdesign.com/" target="_blank">ProBlogDesign</a> and <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a> where I provide various tutorials, how-tos and lists, mostly about WordPress. I have released some WordPress themes as well, the most popular is called OpenBook and the most recent NYC Theme. Apart from blogging, I work as a web developer in a French company and have a lovely wife and a very cute cat.

**What projects are you currently working on?**  
Lots! I&#8217;m making big changes to<a href="http://www.wprecipes.com" target="_blank"> wprecipes.com</a> with a new design and lots of new featur

es. I&#8217;m working on CatsWHoCode.com to improve the blog even more. And at last, I&#8217;m on the point to publish my first blog which is not about web dev things!

**What technologies will become important in your line of work in the near future?**  
I don&#8217;t have any particular technologies in mind, but I wish I have more spare time so I could learn programming for new devices as such as iPhone or Android. That seems so interesting.

**What do you think, is the success of your blog? What would you like to do different if you could start over?**  
Well, I will not call any of my blog &#8220;successful&#8221;. They&#8217;re not ignored, that&#8217;s a sure thing, but they&#8217;re far from being at the level of successful blogs as such as SixRevisions.com!  
I regret lots of bad or poor articles I wrote on CatsWhoCode. If I started with better posts as such as the ones I write now. CWC will be a lot more popular now.

**How did you get the knowledge you master today? Where there seminars, lessons, people, self education or other ways important to become who you are today?**  
I attended web dev training in France some years ago, and I have learned most of my knowledge myself. I&#8217;m so proud of that.  
People should realize that if they want, they can. They don&#8217;t need a teacher or anything. You want to be a good developer? Search, Learn, Work&#8230;and you&#8217;ll be good.

**Do your blogs, CatsWhoCode and lyxia.org, ask a lot of time? How do you handle that workload?**  
I have sold Lyxia.org 7 or 8 months ago, but yes my blogs takes lot of time. You see, it is 11PM and I&#8217;m answering your interview <img src="http://www.devexp.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  
I have no problem handling the workload because I like what I do. It&#8217;s not a job; it is a hobby, something I do with passion.

**What environment do you work on and what applications are important to you?**  
I mostly work on Macs but I use Linux and Windows (Although I don&#8217;t really like it) too. My favorite editors are Vi â€“ because you can find it everywhere â€“ and TextMate because it is powerful and load quickly. I also enjoy Photoshop a lot, but that&#8217;s another story ðŸ˜‰

**If you could start over again from the moment you left high school, what would you do different?**  
Definitely, I&#8217;d launch Premium WordPress themes the first before Darren Hoyt and Brian Gardner. I would be quite rich by now ðŸ˜‰

**Do you have any special hobbies or interests?**  
Beside blogging and web dev related things, I love travelling, especially to New York City. I&#8217;m addicted to that city. Another thing I love are animals. I love doing all I can do to help the Animal Rights cause.

**What are your plans for 2010 or the future in general?**  
Continue to work on my blogs, do my best and maybe, make them successful.

**Quick answers, just answer in maximum 5 words when you read these words:**

1.** Belgium **love that country.  
2. **Apple **The best computers!  
3. **Twitter **Follow @catswhocode ðŸ˜‰  
4. ** Cats **Meow! I just love them.  
5. ** WordPress **My favorite tool to build websites.  
6. **Framework **Use lots of them!  
7. **Global Warming **A tragedy for humans, animals and nature.  
8. **Programming** One of my biggest passions.  
9. ** Internet **10 years I can&#8217;t live without!

Thx a lot Mr Jung, we wish you all the best in the future, and tons of success
