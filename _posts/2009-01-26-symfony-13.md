It’s wonderful that these guys are thinking ahead and keeping us up to date. Why is this important, you ask? Well would you invest in software that isn’t trying to evolve to a better version, to a more reliable version? I don’t think so. Like in our case: We started developing software in October 2007 and needed a part of the project to be PHP-based. The choice of framework wasn’t that easy but the great documentation and the future developments convinced us to use symphony. And we didn’t regret our choice for one minute. Fabien Potencier and his crew keep their promises to the developers and users.

I can quote him as they give good reasons why they should keep us up to date:

  * the users will have time to learn all the great symfony 1.2 features compared to symfony 1.0
  * the core team will have plenty of time to make symfony 1.3 rock solid
  * the documentation team will have time to write even more tutorials and blog posts
  * the plugin developers will have plenty of time to upgrade their plugins to 1.2 with confidence that their work will still be relevant for 1.3.

Great work guys, keep us up to date, in the mean time we’ll do just fine with the 1.2 version.
