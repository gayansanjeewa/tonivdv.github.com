[<img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/5743OS.jpg" width="200" height="317" />][1]I had the opportunity to get a copy of this book for review by <a title="Packt Publishing" href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a>.

As I already have some experience with RabbitMQ, I was more interested to see if this book could be used as a learning material within the company I work for. Not every new developer knows about RabbitMQ and it&#8217;s not easy to start with, especially if you have no background with other queuing systems.

And I was pleasantly surprised while reading the book.

The author first explains what RabbitMQ is all about and what it can do for you. Then quickly goes over the installation process and continues with many different use cases by using an e-commerce shop as example.

The different examples used in the book are carefully put in order of complexity. You will first learn, as in all other langues, how to do a simple &#8220;hello world&#8221; and continue with more complexer use cases. What I liked a lot is that during each example the author carefully explains each concept used. Exchanges, bindings, queues, brokers will not sound like Chinese any more.

To summarize, the book is a very good candidate to learn RabbitMQ quickly without cutting corners! I highly recommend this to beginners. That being said, more experienced developers can still learn one or two things from the advanced examples.

The only negative point I have is that all examples are written in Node.js. Maybe adding a second or third language can be helpful for some readers.
