**Microsoft SuperViewer**

Microsoft recently released a small piece of software on which a web developer can test his application in different browsers. Try it; it might come in rather handy as this will maybe become one of the futures most used debug tools… We don&#8217;t know if this will become a success because the initial release has not been confirmed yet, follow this up&#8230;

**Javascript and the DOM**

Frameworks like jQuery and Prototype speed up development and make it a lot easier to write readable and great JavaScript code, but before starting with those libraries it might be intelligent to study to underlying technologies first. I found a great tutorial in 2 parts on JavaScript and the DOM. Read it and you will understand everything you ever wanted to know. Yeah right <img src="http://www.devexp.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Just read it !!!

Off course this list isn’t complete as I would like to add my own 2 favorite applications:

> **PSPAD**  
> The universal freeware editor, useful for people who:  
> • work with plain text &#8211; the editor has a wealth of formatting functions, including a spell checker  
> • create web pages &#8211; as a web authoring editor, PSPad contains many unique tools that save your time  
> • want to use a good IDE for their compiler &#8211; PSPad catches and parses compiler output, integrates external help files, compares versions and much more&#8230;

> **Eclipse**  
> Eclipse is a multi-language software development platform comprising an IDE and a plug-in system to extend it. It is written primarily in Java and is used to develop applications in this language and, by means of the various plug-ins, in other languages as well—C/C++, Cobol, Python, Perl, PHP and more
