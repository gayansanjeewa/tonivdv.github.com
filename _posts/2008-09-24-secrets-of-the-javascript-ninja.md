  <span lang="EN-US">John Resig is writing a new book that will be released in the fall of 2008 and we are waiting impatiently. It’s called Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja and will be 300 pages full of information for the advanced JavaScript developer. As he says the book will cover cross-browser compatibility issues, I’m already looking forward to the release of it. I’m quite sure that my colleagues and I are not the only ones breaking our heads over that issue. So if you’re interested in designing your own library, or want to know more about them, this is a book for you.</span>

  <span lang="EN-US">Let’s hope the next book will be as helpful in my learning process as the last one he wrote (Pro JavaScript Techniques). More info can be found <a href="http://jsninja.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>
