<img class="alignright" title="Stack Overflow" src="http://stackoverflow.com/Content/Img/stackoverflow-logo-250.png" alt="" width="250" height="70" />I noticed a very helpful website today for programmers. Go and check out <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> if you want to help others or have questions of your own. It doesn’t matter what language you are programming in, the site covers them all. It’s a very simple and easy site that makes it possible for everyone (registered and not registered users) to ask or answer questions. Your answer will be answered by others within minutes. Really great.

I tried it myself and must tell you I’m very pleased with the result. To view my question and answers go <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/491154/round-in-php-shows-power-in-stead-of-full-number" target="_blank">here</a>.

Have fun with it.
