[<img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 3px;" src="http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/flyer.gif" alt="" width="215" height="123" />][1]Symfony, ah we just love the framework&#8230; A year ago we started using this php framework and we wrote a post on it a few months ago (<a title="Symfony: how to refactor" href="http://www.devexp.eu/?p=81" target="_self">read</a>). In 2005 the creators of Symfony wrote a step by step tutorial on how to build a website with their framework. For me and my colleagues, this was the ideal guide to learn it and get to know the best way to use it.

Now, 3 years later, they are publishing a new 24 hour tutorial called Jobeet. If you want to know more and follow this tutorial, click on the link in the sidebar or <a title="Jobeet" href="http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_2/en/" target="_blank">here</a>.
