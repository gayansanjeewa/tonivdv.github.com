Hihi, <a href="http://www.devexp.eu/2009/04/10/the-grass-is-always-greener-in-the-googleplex/" target="_self">I talked about the GooglePlex</a> a few months ago. Seems like the guys had a bit to much of spare time as they created a fire during a BBQ.

This picture was posted on Twitter before the firefighters even got the chance to arrive on the site. I just love the fast spreading technologies. The fire didn&#8217;t do huge damage to the building, but I guess they earned it. Who the hell is barbecuing on a Thursday afternoon anyway, shouldn&#8217;t they be in the Fitness center, the swimming pool or pool hall?

Maybe it&#8217;s just jealousy and I seriously hope nobody was injured, but they deserved it. hi hi.

I checked everybody in my office and they all seem to have a valid alibi. <img src="http://www.devexp.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
