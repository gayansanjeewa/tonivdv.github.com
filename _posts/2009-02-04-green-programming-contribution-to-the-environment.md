Well I wondered how we, as IT guys can contribute to this phenomenon and came up with these answers (after a bit of research).  
In our workspace we can do these things:

  * Write correct and OO code, to save seconds of processing time  
    If you save 3 seconds in a code and this gets executed 1000 times a day for 1 month (30 days) you’ll get a total time of 3\*1000\*30 = 90000 seconds = 1,1 day per month of execution time saved.  
    That’s a huge difference isn’t it? And that’s only what 3 seconds does….
  * Don’t print out everything but use digital copies. Share books, instead of buying two or more copies.
  * Use servers that are hosted in green data centers (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.10.green.aspx" target="_blank">more info</a>)
  * Live close to your work and use public transport (if possible), ride a bike or walk.
  * Be sure to shut down air-conditioning and heating at night.
  * Switch off you system and monitors.
  * And the best one: try to work as less as possible.
