How is it possible that my emails are blocked by spam filters?

I got this question from a few friends and a client and this are the things you can do:

Check your newsletter/email on a spam checker tool  
<a href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/webtools/Spam-Checker/spamchecker.aspx" target="_blank">Programmers heaven spamchecker</a>  
<a href="http://web0.lyris.com/resources/contentchecker/" target="_blank">Lyris contentchecker</a>

The problem for the client was the subject line, in order to get a correct and acceptable subject you need to think carefully about it.  
A spam filter recognizes capitals and exclamation marks and blocks your mail on them, so try to avoid that.  
Make sure your mail/subject doesn’t contain the words on the list you can find <a href="http://www.andreaoneill.com/spamtriggers.html" target="_blank">here </a>  
And also a few others:

  * Try not to use attachments
  * Avoid bcc (blind copy) to send your mail
  * Don’t create an all image email, this big email, that contains all the text in your email, will probably be blocked. Another important issue is that a firewall sometimes removes images from emails so your recipient gets a blank email.
  * So try to create a text-based email. Best thing to do is to provide an html AND text based version of the email.

Good luck.
