A simple SSH connection and Putty makes this possible:

**1. Requirements**

  * Putty SSH client (<a title="download" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">download</a>)
  * SSH access to a server

**2. Configure Putty**

Open the Putty Configuration client, and fill in the field &#8216;*Host Name (or IP address)*&#8216; with the IP or host name of your remote server. In the *Connection type* section you should select *SSH* which will set the port automatically to *22*.

Once this is done, open the *Tunnels* section in the menu *Connection -> SSH*. In this section we are going to configure the port forwarding. Assume we want to access the RabbitMQ management web server which runs on the port 55672. We need to tell Putty to listen on a *Source port* (=local), and to forward it to the *Destination* (=remote). 

For this example we will configure putty to forward port *1234* to the remote port *55672*. 

Fill in the ports as displayed in following screen and then click on *Add*:

If everything is correctly configured click *Open*. This will open a SSH connection with your remote server and at the same time the configured port forwarding. The major drawback is that you cannot see the port forwarding from that screen. If you also use putty to manage your remote server, you will not see the difference. Of course you can always configure the putty screen to be a different color (if you know alternative tricks, please share ðŸ˜‰ )

While the putty connection screens remains open you should be able to access the RabbitMQ management web server by calling *http://localhost:1234* in your favorite browser.

As you can see the procedure is really simple and opens a lot of possibilities without having to open different ports on your remote server. 

Enjoy
