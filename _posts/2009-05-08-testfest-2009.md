Tomorrow on the 9th of may an event called &#8216;PHP TestFest 2009&#8217; will take place in the offices of Combell. (<a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php" target="_blank">visit the website</a>)

**What is TestFest you ask?**

> The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the [code coverage][1] of the [test suite][2] for the PHP language itself. As part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are invited to join the TestFest. These UGs can meet physically or come together virtually. The point however is that people network to learn together. Aside from being an opportunity for all of you to make friends with like minded people in your (virtual) community, it also will hopefully reduce the work load for the PHP.net mentors. All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the event and to get others involved in [writing phpt tests][3]. The submissions will then be reviewed by members of php.net before getting included in the official test suite.

This event will take place in different countries but for the dutch speaking PHP community you can go to these addresses:

Hogeschool Domstad, Koningsbergerstraat 9, 3531 AJ Utrecht,The Netherlands<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-764 alignright" style="margin: 5px;" title="testfest_big-276x300" src="http://www.devexp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/testfest_big-276x300-150x150.png" alt="testfest_big-276x300" width="150" height="150" />

And

Combell offices Ghent, Skaldenstraat 121, 9042 Gent, Belgium (<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2472669/" target="_blank">more info</a>)

There will be a workshop to get the needed information and then it&#8217;s your turn to contribute to the development of the PHP language.

Felix De Vliegher is the mentor for Belgium and did the most tests in 2008 in the whole freaking world. With his experience and vision, this will be a piece of cake, be there or be square&#8230;. (maybe I will write about Felix later in our topic interesting people)

For those who will be on this event, have fun!!!!
